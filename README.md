## Motivation:
<p align="justify">
In 2024, the energy sector undergoes a transformative shift, compelling major utility companies to generate 30-50% of electricity from renewable sources. The reported transition toward renewable energy, outlined by Forbes, introduces both opportunities and challenges. Despite the promise of stand-alone AI (Artificial Intelligence) models for solar activity prediction, their complexity and computational cost limit their effectiveness in capturing simple linear patterns. To address this, our "Solar Vision" project proposes a hybrid model offering a more efficient and reliable solution. This initiative is driven by a commitment to address the global energy challenge, recognizing solar energy as a promising, sustainable source to mitigate environmental impacts and reduce reliance on conventional energy thereby fostering a greener future. For this project, we will use two datasets. Dataset 1, from Wikipedia, provides global insights on "Solar power by country." Dataset 2, from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) website, includes National Solar Radiation Database (NSRD) data for random U.S. cities. Combining these datasets enhances our analysis, offering both global and localized perspectives on solar energy potential. Related work and dataset references are added at the end of this document.

## Methodology:
<p align="justify">
Our investigation began by leveraging Dataset 1 to meticulously scrutinize the top 10 global solar energy producers, shedding light on the key contributors to solar power generation worldwide. Simultaneously, we delved into Dataset 2, analyzing solar radiation patterns in 20 randomly selected U.S. cities. This dual approach provided us with comprehensive insights into both global and local solar potential. Upon analyzing Dataset 1, we uncovered significant findings regarding the top solar-producing countries. Notably, the United States emerged as the second-largest producer of solar power globally, after China. Moreover, the U.S. showcased the highest capacity factor among all countries, underscoring its pivotal role in solar energy generation efficiency. These insights motivated us to further explore solar production dynamics within the U.S., prompting the selection of 20 random cities from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). By meticulously analyzing four years' worth of data for each city, we gained comprehensive insights into localized solar energy dynamics.

## Conclusion and Future Scope:
<p align="justify">
The demonstrated adaptability and effective data management techniques have allowed for the thorough analysis of large-scale solar radiation data, providing valuable insights into potential solar energy generation sites and facilitating strategic decision-making for operational efficiency and energy trading. Moving forward, the proposed hybrid LSTM-ARIMA model aims to improve time-series forecasting accuracy by incorporating additional environmental factors such as wind speed and direction. Furthermore, the development of an anomaly detection system for extreme weather events promises to enhance the resilience of solar energy generation infrastructure. Through comprehensive performance evaluation and ongoing parameter fine-tuning, these advancements hold significant promise for the refinement and optimization of solar energy forecasting and management practices.
